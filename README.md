## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to easily center div vertically and horizontally. 

```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-size: 15px;
}

*, *::after, *::before {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  line-height: 1.5;
  background-color: $very-light-gray;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing in CSS style in future projects using Sass.


### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for the basic HTML and CSS. I really liked this website because its like the dictionary of web development
- [resource 2](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - Sass with superpowers documentaion.
